üéº MAESTRO: A Multi-Agent Engine for Strategic TRade-off Optimization in Autonomous Code Refactoring
MAESTRO is a framework that takes functionally correct but low-quality code and autonomously refactors it into high-quality software through the collaboration and strategic decision-making of specialist AI agents.

‚ú® Core Idea
Code generated by LLMs often "works," but it frequently lacks the essential Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) required in production environments, such as performance, readability, and security. The greater challenge is that these NFRs often have inherent trade-offs (e.g., optimizing for performance can sometimes harm readability).

To solve this, MAESTRO mimics a human expert team. Specialist agents propose improvements, and a central 'Architect' agent orchestrates these conflicting suggestions to create an optimal, unified plan.

üöÄ Key Features
ü§ñ Multi-Agent Collaboration: Three specialist agents for Performance, Readability, and Security analyze the code from multiple dimensions and generate structured improvement reports.

üß† Strategic Decision-Making: A central Architect agent analyzes the conflicting proposals and formulates an optimal, integrated execution plan using a Hierarchical Conflict Resolution Algorithm (HCRA).

üõ†Ô∏è Guided Implementation: A Developer agent meticulously implements the architect's plan without errors.

GATE Automated Quality Validation & Self-Retrospection: An Evaluator agent quantitatively assesses the refactored code using static analysis tools. If the quality score is below a set threshold, it triggers a self-retrospection loop, allowing the architect to revise the plan based on the failure.

üèõÔ∏è Architecture: The ARTEMIS Protocol
MAESTRO operates based on the 4-stage ARTEMIS Protocol:

[Stage 1] Expert Consultation

Each NFR specialist agent analyzes the code and submits a 'Review Report' in a structured JSON format.

[Stage 2] Architect's Decision

The 'Architect' synthesizes the three reports, resolves conflicts, and generates a final 'Integrated Execution Plan'.

[Stage 3] Guided Implementation

The 'Developer' sequentially modifies the code according to the 'Integrated Execution Plan' to produce v_final.

[Stage 4] Final Validation & Self-Retrospection

The 'Evaluator' quantitatively assesses the functional correctness (Unit Tests) and NFR quality of v_final.

If the quality score is below the threshold (e.g., 85), it activates a single-shot retry loop, feeding the failure analysis back to Stage 2.
