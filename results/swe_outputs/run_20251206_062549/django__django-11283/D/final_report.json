Performance reports PERF-001..005 are generic templates and don't match the concrete code; READ-001 indicates missing source in their context and is not actionable. No SecurityExpert report is present, so no Critical security items. [Phase 2] All PERF suggestions target broad, fictitious ranges in main.py and do not map to the provided migration code block; there are no overlapping, concrete conflict points on the actual Django migration. [Phase 3] Applying constitutional principles: (1) Security Primacy: no Critical security suggestions to enforce. (2) Functionality Preservation: the current migration logic is already defensive, checking for existing Permission rows before create; arbitrary performance refactors risk altering ORM behavior or historical migration semantics and could break existing projects' migrations. [Phase 4] Conflict Resolution and Integration: Since the expert proposals are generic and mismatched to this file, they are effectively rejected as not applicable. To resolve the reported IntegrityError, the correct architectural choice is to keep the carefully defensive, idempotent pattern and avoid speculative changes. [Phase 5] Execution Plan Synthesis: With no concrete, applicable suggestions and no test suite, the safest plan that preserves functionality and migration stability is to make no code changes. [Phase 6] Final Plan: Return an empty instructions list, explicitly encoding that no refactor actions are to be taken because none of the expert proposals validly apply to this migration code and ungrounded edits would violate the Functionality Preservation principle.",
